Spin Cycle automates and exposes complex infrastructure tasks to other teams and services. This allows a few engineers to quickly and reliably manage thousands of resources&mdash;platform automation at scale.

Spin Cycle was purpose-built for platform automation at scale:

* Fully REST API-driven 
* Highly available and horizontally scalable
* Real-time status (no dark corners)
* Extensive code reuse (flywheel effect)
* Pluggable role-based authentication

Spin Cycle can do anything you can program. The database team at [Square](https://squareup.com/) uses it to provision and decommission databases, safely stop and start hosts, upgrade MySQL and Docker images, reconfigure services, and more.
